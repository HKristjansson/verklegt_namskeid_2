## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Need to have acces to our local database.

### Installing
```                                                  
pip install -r requirements.txt                     
```                                                    

When the above install is complete, run the program 
by entering the following in terminal (cmd line):   
                                                
```
python manage.py runserver                          
```                                                    

When manage.py is up and running, go to your web    
browser and visit                                   
the site that shows the application:                
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

At this point the project is set up at DEBUG=False so the server should be run with the command
```
python manage.py runserver --insecure
```
or you can set DEBUG=True and then proceed by running in terminal
```
python manage.py runserver
```
